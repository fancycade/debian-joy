When you first boot up a Debian image you will notice that sudo is not a command found.

This guide will go over how to install sudo, and setup a user with sudo privileges.

Since you sudo is not installed we have to change to the root user:
```bash
su -
```

Enter in the root password.

Now we can install the sudo package:
```bash
apt install sudo
```

Lastly, we can put the username in the sudo group:
```bash
usermod -aG sudo *username*
```

Now the user will be able to use sudo without being root.
