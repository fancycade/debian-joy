This example is done with the stretch release, but should work for future versions.

You'll want to make sure your linux kernel is up to date.
Check your linux kernel version:
```bash
uname -r
```

The easiest way to upgrade the linux kernel is to add the backports repository to your /etc/apt/sources.list

For stretch it looks like this:

deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian stretch-backports main

Once you add that line, make sure to run an apt update, to update the package list.

Then upgrade your packages:
```bash
sudo apt-get -t stretch-backports upgrade
```
The -t option means target release

Now that all of our packages our updated we can find a linux kernel to update.

First search for the list of linux-kernels:
```bash
apt search linux-image
```

You don't want the linux-headers, an rt version, or a cloud version.

In the list find the latest linux kernel, and then we can use apt to install it. For example:
```bash
sudo apt-get -t stretch-backports install linux-image-4.11.0-0.bpo.1-amd64
```

Once this is complete, reboot. Then check the linux version, it should be greater than the last one.

Then comment out all the mentions of stretch.

Depending on how far the release is in its cycle, this might be different.

But if you want the main stuff, add this:

```bash
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian buster main
deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian buster main
```

Run `apt update` to make sure there are no errors.

Then you can safely run `apt upgrade`

If there are any errors make sure to take care of them. Running `apt autoremove` doesn't hurt

And a `dist-upgrade` for good measure

Then reboot. Since the distro got upgraded, you should even see different lock screens.
