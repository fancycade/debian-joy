This example is done with the stretch release, but should work for future versions.

You'll want to make sure your linux kernel is up to date.
Check your linux kernel version:
```bash
uname -r
```

The easiest way to upgrade the linux kernel is to add the backports repository to your /etc/apt/sources.list

For stretch it looks like this:

deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian stretch-backports main

Then simply use apt to upgrade:

sudo apt-get -t stretch-backports upgrade

The -t option means target release

Once this is complete, reboot. Then check the linux version, it should be greater than the last one.

Then comment out all the mentions of stretch.

Depending on how far the release is in its cycle, this might be different.

But if you want the main stuff, add this:

```bash
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian buster main
deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian buster main
```

Run `apt update` to make sure there are no errors.

Then you can safely run `apt upgrade`

If there are any errors make sure to take care of them. Running `apt autoremove` doesn't hurt

And a `dist-upgrade` for good measure

Then reboot. Since the distro got upgraded, you should even see different lock screens.
