This example is done with the stretch release, but should work for future versions.

You'll want to make sure your linux kernel is up to date. Check upgrade_linux_kernel.md on how to do that.

Go to `/etc/apt/sources.list` and comment/delete all mentions of stetch.

Depending on how far the release is in its cycle, this might be different.

But if you want the main stuff, add this:

```bash
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian buster main
deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian buster main
```

Run `apt update` to make sure there are no errors.

Then you can safely run `apt upgrade`

Note: This process uses a decent amount of disk space while all of the old packages are still installed. So make sure your QEMU image size is bigger than 2G.

Which will increase the image size by 1 Gigabyte.

If there are any errors make sure to take care of them. Running `apt autoremove` doesn't hurt

And a `dist-upgrade` for good measure

Then reboot. Since the distro got upgraded, you should even see different lock screens.
