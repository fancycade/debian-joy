1. cat /proc/acpi/wakeup list devices with wakeup events

To do the fix we need to disable a few things:

2. echo LID0 > /proc/acpi/wakeup # If you disable lid, have to press power button supposedly...
3. echo XHC1 > /proc/acpi/wakeup

In order for these changes to persistent they have to be placed in /etc/rc.local

Now things should work as expected, maybe...
