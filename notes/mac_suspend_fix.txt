1. cat /proc/acpi/wakeup list devices with wakeup events

To do the fix we need to disable a few things:

2. echo LID0 > /proc/acpi/wakeup # If you disable lid, have to press power button supposedly...
3. echo XHC1 > /proc/acpi/wakeup

In order for these changes to persistent they have to be placed in /etc/rc.local

Now things should work as expected, maybe...

The next thing to check is your OS's power settings. This bug can prop up if your computer goes into hibernation mode. Make sure sleep mode for battery and plugged in is set to suspend.
