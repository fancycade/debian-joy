# Debian Joy Project

Project originated by Harley Swick, to make the usage, development of GNU/Linux and Free Software in general more joyful.

This idea of joy is heavily inspired by the Ruby philosophy of developer happiness.

# How does this project 'spark joy'?

It tries to only include, or at least emphasize, software that brings joy to me

This includes:
Ruby + Rake
- Idea is to use Rake for build tools, and other automation

Rust
- Rust is powerful and is the preferred way to make desktop apps
- Relm

Emacs
- emacs is my preferred editor
- mistydaytheme.el

Xfce
- Lightweight Desktop Environment that has a cute mouse as a logo

Papirus
- Flat Icon Theme
apt install papirus-icon-theme
